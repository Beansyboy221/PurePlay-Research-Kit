# PurePlay Research Kit (PPRK)

**Free, Open-Source Tool for Anti-Cheat Research and Development**

## Overview

The **PurePlay Research Kit (PPRK)** is a tool designed for researchers and developers to experiment with deep learning architectures for behavior-based cheat detection. It focuses on identifying anomalous input signatures such as those generated by Xim, Cronus, or custom Arduino-based "spoofers" by analyzing raw GamePad, Mouse, and Keyboard data streams.

Unlike traditional signature-based anti-cheats, PPRK provides the ability to identify input-augmenting cheats without intrusive system access. This toolkit is intended for **academic research, security auditing, and the development of next-generation behavioral models** that function independently of game memory.

- *Note: This project is in development and is not designed for real-world implementation. Data collection features only currently support Windows OS.*

## Features

- **Data Acquisition**: Capture high-fidelity input data from Gamepads, Mice, and Keyboards for dataset generation.
- **Cross-Engine Benchmarking**: Operates externally from the game process, allowing for easier comparison between games.
- **Research-ready Configuration**: Offers extensive tuning for custom dataset and model creation.

## Getting Started
